## Hi, I'm WrettySV

I build projects across **computer vision / ML**, **robotics simulation & navigation**, and **full‑stack / backend engineering**.  
My GitHub includes work ranging from ML notebooks to Java/TypeScript coursework and infrastructure practice.

### What I work on
- **Computer Vision / ML**: segmentation and object-related tasks (training, experiments, notebooks)
- **Robotics / Navigation**: simulation-based navigation projects and tooling
- **Web Development**: JavaScript/TypeScript practice (AJAX/DOM) and frontend infrastructure exercises
- **Backend / Java**: REST and backend coursework, collections/streams practice, and related tooling

### Highlighted repositories (from my GitHub)
- **MRI-Based-Brain-Tumor-Segmentation** — notebook-based ML segmentation work
- **ObjectHunting** — CV/ML exploration
- **Habitat-Robotics-NavSim** — robotics navigation/simulation project

### Tech I touch (from projects here)
- **Languages**: Python, Java, TypeScript/JavaScript
- **Areas**: ML/CV, robotics simulation, REST APIs, frontend tooling
